# Overview

Create a PYTHON 3 script named `cf-ddns-sync.py` to update Cloudflare DNS A records with the IPv4 addresses from specified network interfaces.

The script must start with a shebang for python 3 language.

The script must use only libraries from The Python Standard Library. For http requests, use `urllib` and `json`.

Use the Cloudflare REST API (documentation available at https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/) to perform the updates.

Cloudlare API requires an API TOKEN for authentication.



The script should have a command-line argument parser that accepts the following options:

    cf-ddns-sync.py --apiToken 145976123897469278364 --zoneId aabbccddeeff --target host1.example.com --source eth0 --source eth1

- `--apiToken`: (Required) Specifies the Cloudflare API Token for API authentication.
- `--zoneId`: (Required) Identifies the DNS Zone ID for the target DNS record, necessary for API calls.
- `--target`: (Required) Provides the hostname for the Cloudflare DNS record, which must already exist in the specified zone. Lets call it TARGET_HOSTNAME.
- `--source`: (Optional) Lists the network interfaces from which to retrieve IPv4 addresses; can accept zero, one, or multiple interfaces.
- `--ttl`: (Optional) Integer value for the `ttl` property of the DNS records.  If unspecified, it should default to `60`.

The script must strictly avoid outputting any content to `stdout`.

When invoked with the `-v` or `--verbose` flags, it may produce specific informative messages (referred to as verbose messages), which should be directed exclusively to `stderr`.

The argument parser should validate all inputs and provide usage instructions if `-h` or `--help` is passed.

Upon validation of all arguments, the script execution should proceed as follows:



# STEP 1: Determine the list of public IPv4 addresses.

For each specified network interface in `--source`, the script should retrieve the public IPv4 address associated with that interface following these steps:

1. **Retrieve Local IPv4 Address**: First, obtain the local IPv4 address of each interface (`$SOURCE_INTERFACE_NAME` in the code below) using the `ip` command:

        ip -4 -oneline address show $SOURCE_INTERFACE_NAME

    The result will be the first match found from the output of the above command against the regex `((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)\.?\b){4}`

2. **Query Public IPv4 Address**: Once the local IP is identified, use `dig` command to query the public IPv4 address from a DNS server:

        dig -b $IFACE_LOCAL_IPV4_ADDRESS +short txt ch whoami.cloudflare @1.1.1.1

    The output of the above command will include double quotes around the result, which should be removed.

In verbose mode, the script should display the verbose message `Got IPv4 address '$PUBLIC_IPV4_ADDRESS' for interface '$SOURCE_INTERFACE_NAME'.` immediately after executing the `dig` command. This message must appear for each network interface specified in `--source`, providing clarity on the interface being processed.



However, if no `--source` argument is provided, the script should skip retrieving the local IPv4 address and directly use the `dig` command without specifying the `-b` option:

    dig +short txt ch whoami.cloudflare @1.1.1.1

The output of the above command will include double quotes around the result, which should be removed.



In verbose mode, the script should display the verbose message `Got IPv4 address '$PUBLIC_IPV4_ADDRESS'.` immediately after executing the `dig` command.

If the `dig` command for a given network interface returns an empty response that network interface must be ignored.

If the `dig` command for a specific network interface returns an IPv4 address that has already been returned by another interface, that IPv4 address should be disregarded and not added to the list again.

If no public IPv4 address could be obtained from any interface, the script should write `ERROR: Cannot get public IPv4 address.` to `stderr` and exit immediately with a status code of `1`.

The expected result of this step is a list of public IPv4 addresses called SOURCE_IPV4_ADDRESSES. This list must be sorted.



# STEP 2: Determine the DNS A Records for target hostname.

The DNS A Records for TARGET_HOSTNAME can be queried using the Cloudflare API.

However, to avoid many unnecessary calls to the API, a cache mechanism should be implemented following these rules:

   - Cache Location: Store the cache in `/var/cache/cf-ddns/${TARGET_HOSTNAME}.cache` as a JSON file.

   - Cache Format: The cache file must contain
      - `timestamp`: Unix timestamp of when the cache was last updated.
      - `records`: Array of DNS A records from the last Cloudflare API response. This array must be sorted by the ip address of each element.

   - Cache Validation:
      - If the cache file doesn't exists or isn't readable, fetch the records from Cloudflare API.
      - If any of ipv4 address in SOURCE_IPV4_ADDRESSES are not present in local cache, fetch the records from Cloudflare API.
      - If the count of elements in SOURCE_IPV4_ADDRESSES differs from the count of elements in local cache, fetch the records from Cloudflare API.
      - Otherwise, use the local cached records.

   In verbose mode, the script should display the verbose message: `DNS A records for '$TARGET_HOSTNAME' = $LIST_OF_IP_ADDRESSES` where LIST_OF_IP_ADDRESSES is the list of ip addresses obtained from cache or from API. If obtained from cache the verbose message must also append the suffix ` (Cached)`.
   
   If no records are returned (from cache or API) this step must return an empty list.

   The expected result of this step is a list of DNS A Records called TARGET_DNS_RECORDS. This list must be sorted by the ip address of each record.



# STEP 3: Compare and Synchronize DNS A Records for target hostname.

Now, to synchronize the list TARGET_DNS_RECORDS with the list SOURCE_IPV4_ADDRESSES the perform the following steps:

For each IP in SOURCE_IPV4_ADDRESSES, check if thereâ€™s a corresponding DNS A record in TARGET_DNS_RECORDS. There are 4 possible scenarios:

  - Skip: If an existing record already has the correct IP, skip the update to avoid redundant API calls.
  - Insert: If an IP in SOURCE_IPV4_ADDRESSES does not exist in TARGET_DNS_RECORDS, create a new DNS A record for it.
  - Update: If a matching DNS A record exists but with a different IP, update the record with the new IP.
  - Delete: For any IP in TARGET_DNS_RECORDS that is not present in SOURCE_IPV4_ADDRESSES, delete the DNS A record to ensure synchronization.

In `Insert` or `Update` scenarios, the API call payload must include a `ttl` property, with the value specified through the `--ttl` argument.

In verbose mode, for each of the four possible scenarios above, the script should display a corresponding verbose message:
  - Skip: `Skipping '$TARGET_DNS_RECORD'.`
  - Insert: `Adding '$SOURCE_IPV4_ADDRESS' to '$TARGET_DNS_RECORD'.`
  - Update: `Updating '$SOURCE_IPV4_ADDRESS' in '$TARGET_DNS_RECORD'.`
  - Delete: `Removing '$SOURCE_IPV4_ADDRESS' from '$TARGET_DNS_RECORD'.`

Once all synchronization API calls have been executed, it is essential to refresh the local cache file to ensure that its data remains consistent with the changes made through the API.

When writing the cache file, if necessary, create the cache directory.

For all API calls of this step the HTTP response will always be in JSON format. If the `success` property in the JSON response is `false`, the script should:

  1. Write `ERROR: $error_message (code: $error_code).` to `stderr`, where `$error_code` and `$error_message` correspond to the `code` and `message` properties of the first object in the `errors` array of the JSON response.

  2. Exit immediately with a status code of `1`



The final outcome should be that TARGET_DNS_RECORDS reflects the exact set of IPv4 addresses in SOURCE_IPV4_ADDRESSES, ensuring the DNS records are accurate and up-to-date with the public IPs of the specified interfaces.
